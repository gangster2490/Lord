CURRENT STAGE: FINAL_PROMPT

Generate the production-ready VEO 3.1 package for Gemini / VEO copy-paste.
Keep every section SHORT and copy-ready. No essays. No repeated doctrine.

Voice language: $voice
  DE: natural German ~12–18 spoken words
  RU: natural Russian ~14–22 spoken words
  OFF: VOICEOVER section says OFF
TikTok Shop Mode: ${if (tiktokShop) "ON" else "OFF"}
${lockedVoiceoverBlock(voice, lockedVoiceover)}
Do not resend or invent unseen mechanisms.
Do NOT include TIKTOK SHOP SAFETY AUDIT inside veoPrompt.

SECTION LENGTH RULES (hard — keep the copied prompt SHORT):
FORMAT: one short line (9:16, photorealistic, exactly 8.0s)
REFERENCES: ONE short sentence of what photos confirm
PRODUCT LOCK: one short lock sentence + ONE line of 5–8 product-specific details (no fidelity essay)
SETTING: one short line
SHOT SEQUENCE: exactly four short timed lines (0.0–2.0 / 2.0–4.0 / 4.0–6.0 / 6.0–8.0). No meta paragraphs.
ON-SCREEN TEXT: ONLY the actual overlay words that may appear in the video (or None). Never put production instructions, limits, or prompt labels here.
VOICEOVER: spoken line or OFF
AUDIO: one short line
CRITICAL: one short line
NEGATIVE PROMPT: 5–6 short bullets, product-specific when possible
TITLE: one short title
HASHTAGS: exactly 5
Target total veoPrompt length: under ~1200 characters.

Return JSON only. veoPrompt MUST be one JSON string. Use $nl for line breaks. Never put raw line breaks inside the JSON string.

Never truncate mid-section. Never omit the TITLE/HASHTAGS tail. If length is tight, shorten section bodies — do not drop sections.
Do NOT paste long internal fidelity essays into PRODUCT LOCK or CRITICAL.
Do NOT duplicate marketplace rules across sections.
Do NOT include legacy sections: VISUAL FIDELITY, PRODUCT FIDELITY, SAFETY AUDIT, QUALITY GATE, CREATIVE DIRECTOR, PRODUCT MODEL, PRIMARY/MAIN REFERENCE.
Only the 12 required section headers may appear in veoPrompt.
ON-SCREEN TEXT must never contain production instructions (e.g. "Max 2–3 overlays", "No price"). Only real overlay copy or None.
